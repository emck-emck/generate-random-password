This script is a random password generator.

The password consists of numbers 0-9, lowercase letters a-z, uppercase letters A-Z, and symbols !-) (shift-number).

The script is used by typing "python generateRandomPassword.py <number>" where <number> is the length of the password you want to generate.
By default the script generates a password 8 characters long.

I made this script because I was getting sick of going to websites to generate random passwords for me.
Don't ask me what I'm doing to remember the passwords I generate ;)
